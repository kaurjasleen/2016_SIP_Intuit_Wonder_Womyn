       Find over 7 million jobs at the click of a button, customized to fit your search. <br>
       Don't limit yourself to using one job finder website or having to go through the torture of 
       creating accounts in each site and finding out that they don't have what you need. 
       Instead, use WonderWomyn to search through all the big job finder web sites for the job you think is right for you.

      <p class="job"> Before you start to look for a job, remember these tips: <br>
       <div class = "tips"> 
        - To get a job, you need to have the necessary skills.<br>
       - Update your resume. If you do not have one, create one. Don't forget, bragging is not a bad thing.(f you need help with building your resume, go to <a href="https://www.resumehelp.com/resume/how-it-works.aspx"> Resume Helper</a>)<br> 
     - Don't solely rely on online applications. Make sure to follow up by going to the store in person. <br>
     - Update your LinkedIn profile. These are just as important as resumes.<br>
     - Set yourself apart through your application, resume, and LinkedIn. You want to be remembered.<br>
     - Polish your social media. You don't want the employer/company to have a bad impression of you. <br>
     - Keep an open mind. Sometimes you receive oppurtunities that might not be what you want, but they will be  
     &nbsp what you need. <br>
