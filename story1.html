        <p>In Rwanda, girls are often seen to have only two roles during their lives: daughter and then wife. Ni Nyampinga showcases a different reality: that girls are Rwanda's greatest untapped source of economic and social growth. One way of doing this is to expose girls to positive role models who have broken through the invisible barriers holding them back. These Ni Nyampinga heroes are not only changing the way Rwanda views girls, but the way girls view themselves.</p>
