        <p>Football is only for boys? Try telling that to girl hero Consolé. Her love of football has been challenged since she was a child, but that hasn't stopped her from becoming a coach for the Rambura Women's Football Club. Her community, colleagues and even her family questioned why she wanted to get into a "man's sport". Time and again they told her she was wasting her time. But their words only made Consolé more determined to achieve her dream – a career in football.
By believing in herself instead of what other people thought she should be doing, Consolé has smashed negative perceptions of girls playing football into the back of the net. Now she coaches a team in the Rwanda Women's Football League. 
Those who originally doubted her have now realised that football isn't just a man's game. Consolé's community and family are benefiting from her coaching, but most importantly, she's fulfilling her own purpose.
