        <p>Patience was forced to drop out of school when her parents refused to pay the fees for her education. But the idea that this was the end of her education never crossed her mind. Nothing was going to stop her from learning.
From cultivating crops to selling solar lamps, Patience took on jobs to pay for her own school fees. However, she hit another obstacle when her mother fell ill. Patience had to nurse her mother and look after her siblings, which meant her studies suffered. She failed the exam that would have kept her in school.
Despite this setback and her family responsibilities, Patience never gave up on her education and at 19 years old, sheâ€™s back at school. Her story is proof that there is no age limit for learning. Patience is an inspiration to other girls who struggle to stay in school.
