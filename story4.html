        <p>In Rwanda, children with disabilities often face discrimination and are typically excluded from school and their communities. But 12-year-old Esther is challenging the common perception of being a disabled girl. 
After being born with a leg disability, Esther often felt like an outsider but her mother and teachers encouraged her to believe in herself as she had the potential of any other child. She has used this confidence to speak up for children of her age and teach girls about reproductive health.
This would be an incredible feat for any girl, but the obstacles that Esther has had to overcome to reach this position makes her story even more inspiring. She has proved that being disabled doesn't mean you aren't capable of empowering yourself and other girls in your community.</p>
