        <p>If you haven’t heard of Yegna, you are missing out on something big. The multi-platform drama, featuring the five dynamic characters of Melat, Mimi, Emuye, Sara and Lemlem, has been challenging the way people think about girls – and the way girls think about themselves – for more than two years.
Through compelling storylines, original songs and a weekly radio talk show, Yegna has taken on challenging issues, such as child marriage, and shown girls how to take control of their own futures.
Fan favourite Mimi is a survivor of child marriage and, in one hard-hitting storyline, she stands up to her former husband thanks to the support of her Yegna friends and bandmates. Confronting real-life issues such as early marriage has helped Yegna not only have an impact on girls’ lives, but also changed how boys and men view a girl’s role within Ethiopian society.
About 75 per cent of girl listeners say Yegna has helped them make realistic plans for their future and more than half of adult listeners have said the show has encouraged them to keep their children in school. These five amazing girls have created genuine social change. Keep up the good work, Yegna. 
As a child, Danedjo in Cameroon dreamt of becoming a doctor, but when she was 15 her family promised her to a man three times her age. This wasn’t the life she wanted.
Danedjo did something that had never happened in her village before. She said no to marriage. With help from a community worker, she escaped her wedding ceremony, but now Danedjo has returned to her village to make sure other girls do not face the same situation she did as a child.
And she’s just getting started. In November, she joined experts and policymakers at the Girl Summit DC 2015 to talk about the best ways to end child marriage for good. </p>
