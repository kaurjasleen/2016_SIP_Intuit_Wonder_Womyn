        Opportunity. College is the key to opportunities in life. It is the first step to a stronger, better future. College opens doors for you that high school doesn't, 
        it can change you and shape you in ways that you might not imagine. College work will challenge and inspire you. In college, you will get to explore subjects 
        in greater depth than you did in high school, choose your own courses and class schedule, and decide which extracurricular activities youâ€™ll focus on and how 
        much time you will give them.
